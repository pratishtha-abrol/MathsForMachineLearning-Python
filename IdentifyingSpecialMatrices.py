# Matrices in Python
# In the numpy package in Python, matrices are indexed using zero for the top-most column and left-most row. I.e., the matrix structure looks like this:

# A[0, 0]  A[0, 1]  A[0, 2]  A[0, 3]
# A[1, 0]  A[1, 1]  A[1, 2]  A[1, 3]
# A[2, 0]  A[2, 1]  A[2, 2]  A[2, 3]
# A[3, 0]  A[3, 1]  A[3, 2]  A[3, 3]
# You can access the value of each element individually using,
# A[n, m]
# which will give the n'th row and m'th column (starting with zero). You can also access a whole row at a time using,
# A[n]
# Which you will see will be useful when calculating linear combinations of rows.

# A final note - Python is sensitive to indentation. All the code you should complete will be at the same level of indentation as the instruction comment.

# Our function will go through the matrix replacing each row in order turning it into echelon form.
# If at any point it fails because it can't put a 1 in the leading diagonal,
# we will return the value True, otherwise, we will return False.
