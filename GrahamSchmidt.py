# Matrices in Python
# Remember the structure for matrices in numpy is,

# A[0, 0]  A[0, 1]  A[0, 2]  A[0, 3]
# A[1, 0]  A[1, 1]  A[1, 2]  A[1, 3]
# A[2, 0]  A[2, 1]  A[2, 2]  A[2, 3]
# A[3, 0]  A[3, 1]  A[3, 2]  A[3, 3]
# You can access the value of each element individually using,
# A[n, m]
# You can also access a whole row at a time using,
# A[n]
# Building on last assignment, in this exercise you will need to select whole columns at a time. This can be done with,
# A[:, m]
# which will select the m'th column (starting at zero).
# In this exercise, you will need to take the dot product between vectors. This can be done using the @ operator. To dot product vectors u and v, use the code,
# u @ v

# Our first function will perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure for 4 basis vectors.
# We'll take this list of vectors as the columns of a matrix, A.
# We'll then go through the vectors one at a time and set them to be orthogonal
# to all the vectors that came before it. Before normalising.
